        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a PhD student focusing on designing human-centered AI solutions to empower communities. My research interests include creating equitable and fair AI systems by putting the needs of users and impacted populations at the forefront. By combining insights from human-computer interaction, social sciences, and AI, I aim to strengthen individual and collective decision-making in AI-integrated environments, especially in public settings and information systems.
